-> nothing more to give about feed back to the course.

-> i want more related examples like crandy crush , and motivation class for this group.
       To be honest i don't know anything about the course but now i want to work more and take more time for this course . 

->  we need some basic concepts of the course in the tutorial session , because nothing learned before semester.

Week 4

-> As we discussed in the class is absolute fine and intresting but , in my opinion i havn't got about Scrum . 
it's better if we go more deep .
